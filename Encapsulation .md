# üêç Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## üéØ AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.

---

## üß† ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

## üíª Program

```
  class Rectangle:
    __length = 0 
    __breadth = 0
    def __init__(self):
      self.__length = 5
      self.__breadth = 3
      print(self.__length)
      print(self.__breadth)
   
  obj = Rectangle()
```

## Output

![441540940-46bd4017-fa10-4b86-9eb7-039a6158585a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bf23cd9-aaf2-4358-838e-539edd162088)

## Result

Thus the program to implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth` is executed successfully.
